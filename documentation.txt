Activity 1:
Here's how Microsoft Copilot assisted in improving the API code and functionality:

1) Scaffolding the Project:

Microsoft Copilot helped set up the basic structure of the project by providing boilerplate code for Program.cs.

2) Generating the User Model:

Copilot generated the User model, specifying properties like Id, FirstName, LastName, and Email.

3) Creating CRUD Endpoints:

Copilot provided the necessary code to create, update, retrieve, and delete user records, ensuring that all CRUD operations are covered.

4) Ensuring Best Practices:

Copilot suggested using CreatedAtAction for the POST endpoint, which is a best practice for returning the location of the newly created resource.

It also suggested using NoContent status for PUT and DELETE operations to indicate successful completion of the request.

5) Improving Code Readability:

Copilot generated code with clear structure and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain.



Activity 2:

1) Validation: Copilot suggested adding data annotations to the User model to enforce validation rules.

2) Error handling: Copilot recommended wrapping critical code sections in try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.

3) Performance improvements: Copilot suggested implementing pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.

Activity 3:

1) Token Generation: Copilot helped create the TokenController to generate JWT tokens for authenticated access.

2) Authentication Middleware: Copilot assisted in implementing middleware to validate JWT tokens and bypass the token generation endpoint.

3) Error Handling Middleware: Copilot provided code to catch and handle unhandled exceptions consistently across all endpoints.

4) Logging Middleware: Copilot generated middleware to log all incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses for auditing purposes.

5) Middleware Configuration: Copilot guided the correct order and setup of middleware in Program.cs to ensure robust and secure operations.
